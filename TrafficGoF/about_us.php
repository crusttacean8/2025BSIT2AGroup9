  <p>
    At Traffic Go, we’re dedicated to making urban mobility smarter, faster, and more efficient. 
    Our platform uses intelligent forecasting to determine the most optimal times for traffic lights 
    to STOP or GO — reducing congestion, saving time, and helping communities move better.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we go beyond just traffic lights. We believe that a truly efficient city starts with accountability 
    and innovation. That’s why we also propose road-side sensor systems to detect improperly parked or idle 
    vehicles, alerting enforcers in real time. This integrated approach ensures that both commuters 
    and traffic systems work in sync for a smoother flow.
